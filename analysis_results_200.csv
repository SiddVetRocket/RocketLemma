Right lateral views were initially provided. Opposite lateral and VD views were acquired after radiologist's request. There is quantum mottling to varying degrees in all images most notably in the cranial abdomen. 

There is normal serosal margin detail in the mid to caudal abdomen; assessment of the cranial abdomen is hindered by quantum mottling (i.e. underexposure) artifact. In the initial right lateral views, there is the impression of small intestinal plication in the cranial to mid ventral abdomen. In the subsequent images, the small intestinal segments in this region of the abdomen no long contain gas but there is a continue impression of at least small intestinal bunching in the cranial to mid ventral abdomen in the additionally provided images. The remaining visible intra-abdominal structures are normal. 
","The appearance of the small intestine in the cranial to mid ventral abdomen is concerning but not conclusive for a linear foreign body obstruction and secondary intestinal plication. Quantum mottling artifact in the cranial abdomen hinders assessment to some degree. 

Medical management overnight and repeat abdominal imaging (ideally abdominal ultrasound as repeat abdominal radiographs may have the same technical issues which could further assessment) could be considered. Alternatively, given history, exploratory laparotomy could be considered.

803530,"Two radiographs are availalbe for interpretation dated June 17, 2025. They are right lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs of the combined thorax and abdomen. 

On the VD view, there is left lateralized fluid/soft tissue opacity occupying the left pleural space with what appears to be retracted left caudal lung. There is concurrent suspect mild leftward mediastinal shift. On the right lateral view this left pleural opacity is not as well appreciated and there is a hazy increased opacity summating with the perihilar to caudodorsal region and cranioventral thorax, and a pleural fissure or lobar sign overlying the caudal margin of the silhouette, suggesting pleural effusion. The right sided pumonary parenchyma appears normal on the VD view despite a fairly generalized haziness to the parenchyma on the lateral view. There is the appearance of vascular congestion near the hilus on the lateral views, however, vessels seem normal on the VD view. Cardiac silhouette is considered normal in size and shape. No evidence of rib lesion or other significant thoracic musculoskeletal abnormality. 

The peritoneal detail is normal within the abdomen. On the lateral view only there is a patchy increased softt issue opacity dorsal to the kidneys and ventral to L1-L3. Also, a few round to ovoid soft tissue nodular opacities are summating with the caudal retroperitoneal space.The liver is mildly diffusely enlarged with normal margination. The gastrointestinal tract is normal. The urinary bladder is small and normal in opacity. There is a well-defined ovoid mineral opaque nodule with discrete peripheral rim int he carnioventral abdomen. 
","\- The radiographs are concerning for left sided unilateral pleural effusion which given the history and lateralization is most concerning for pyothorax. There is suspect atelectasis subsequently of the left lungs though a pulmonary infectious infiltrate is also possible. An underlying pleural and/or pulmonary neoplasia (carcinoma) with pleural effusion or hemorrahge is not ruled out. Thoracocentesis (ultrasound guided if possible) is recommended, followed by cytology and culture of any fluid acquired. Pyothorax is managed ideally with culture of fluid, chest tube placement and flushing, though sometimes non-responsive cases require advanced imaging (CT of thorax) with thoracotomy. Medical management solely is not ideal but also not wrong to attempt when other avenues are unavailable. Heart failure is considered less likely given the unilaterality of the changes and lack of cardiomegaly, however, the mild vascular congestion does suggest some degree of increased circulatory fluid or cardiac overload; would recommend discontinuing steroids in case a pre-existing cardiac condition is present that prediposes patient to fluid/circulatory overload and failure. Given the time lapse repeat three view (left, right and either DV or VD) thoracic radiographs collimated to the thorax (from thoracic inlet to mid stomach) could be considered to re-evaluate and see if any changes have allowed for better visualization of pleural versus pulmonary versus cardiovascular pathology. 
\-  The patchy increased opacity dorsal to renal silhouette on lateral view may be summation artifact with vascualture and splenic head/body, however mild perinephric steatitis and/or effusion, such as from pyelonephritis or other renal disease, is not entirely ruled out. Correlate to laboratory findings and/or urinalysis. 
\- Mild hepatomegaly is non-specific and may be a benign incidental finding, however, inflammation or less likely neoplasia are not ruled out. 
\- Small nodular soft tissue opacities superimposed with the caudal retroperitoneal space on lateral view may be incidentally conspicuous lymph nodes, end-on vasculature artifact, or mildly enlarged lymph nodes.
\- Mineralized nodule of the cranioventral abdomen is most consistent with an incidental Bates body/fat necrosis.

Abdominal serosal margination is adequate. The gastric lumen is small and contains small-volume gas on the lateral view. The small intestines are diffusely small, uniform, and homogeneously soft tissue opaque with a few segments within the caudal abdomen containing small-volume gas. The large intestine contains small-volume, formed fecal material distally and small-volume gas proximally. An indistinctly defined, homogeneous soft tissue structure is identified within the mid-abdomen and is superimposed on the small intestines on the lateral view, likely representing the left kidney. The colon is compressed and markedly narrows within the dorsal mid-abdomen on the lateral view, with caudomedial displacement of the transverse colon on the VD image. The viewable margins of the liver and urinary bladder are normal. The left renal silhouette is normal in the VD view, and the right kidney is not clearly identified. The spleen is mildly diffusely enlarged, extending caudally and likely present within the right mid to caudolateral abdomen on the VD image, causing a moderate ovoid soft tissue mass effect. This mass effect is not identified on the lateral image due to rotation. A convex, cranially indistinctly defined, homogeneous soft tissue structure is within the plane of the cranial pelvic inlet at the urinary bladder neck and at the level of the prostate on the lateral views. There is reduced caudal peritoneal fat opacity at this level.

The medullary cavities of these ribs are irregularly widened distally and narrowed proximally, and variably shaped. The remainder of the viewable osseous and soft tissue structures are normal. There is a region of partially well defined to indistinctly defined soft tissue opacity within the region of the right middle lung lobe and into cranial aspect of the right caudal lung lobe. This is likely partially visible on the right lateral image and visible in the perihilar region or represents additional left lung changes. Many indistinct soft tissue opaque nodules are throughout the lung fields bilaterally. The cardiac silhouette is subjectively normal, however is partially obscured by the pulmonary changes. There is a homogeneous soft tissue opacity within the viewable cranial mediastinal space that is effacing the cranial cardiac silhouette on all views. However, the forelimbs are superimposed with the cranial thorax, hampering the assessment of the cranial mediastinal structures and pleural space. A well-defined, angular, gas opacity is within the plane of the mid esophagus on the lateral views.

Soft tissue opacity dorsal to the carina and mainstem bronchi may suggest tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy or may be artifactual.  CT would be best to further evaluate.  
Mild narrowing of the carina and mainstem bronchi suggest some degree of chondromalacia and this may be exacerbated if tracheobronchial lymph adenopathy is present compressing these airways.
Mineralized foci within the liver presumably associated with the biliary tract and may be incidental or may suggest chronic cholangiohepatitis.  Consider in light of blood work findings.  
Mineral foci just caudal to fluid in the cranial abdomen may represent nonobstructive foreign bodies in the gastrointestinal tract or maybe represent mineralization in the plane of the extrahepatic bile duct or pancreas, potentially representing choliliths and/or pancreatolithiasis.

No conclusive normalities are identified on any of the images acquired on March 19, 2025.  However, on several of the images on March 26, 2025, the proximal osseous margin bordering the distal radial physis is markedly mineral opaque, mildly flared, and irregular.  This is significantly different from the appearance of this portion of the left distal radius on the earlier images and is significantly different than normal the appearance of the right distal radius on images from any date.  Similarly, the proximal osseous margin bordering the distal physis of the left ulna is flared, mildly more mineral opaque than typical, and irregular in shape, all of which differs from the appearance of this margin of the left distal ulnar on the previous exam and differs from the appearance of the right ulnar physis on images from any date.

Provided are right lateral and ventrodorsal radiographs of the thorax and abdomen, 4 images total. The study is dated February 26, 2025.

Thorax: There is moderate general enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with dorsal displacement of the caudal trachea/carina and more focal marked left atrial enlargement and protrusion in the area of the left auricle. The cranial pulmonary vein appears mildly enlarged/congested compared to its respective artery on the lateral view. There is a mild to moderate caudodorsal unstructured interstitial pattern, more severe left sided on the VD view. On the lateral view, at the level of the costochondral junctions, there is a conspicuous line of soft tissue opacity that extends cranial to caudal over the ventral thorax, with fat opacity and conspicuity of the cardiac silhouette apex ventral to the soft tissue margin/line. There is an ovoid soft tissue opaque to questionably faintly mineral opaque subcutaneous mass (6.2cm x 3.5cm) of the dorsal soft tissues, superimposed with the spinous processes. This mass very likely correlates with an ill-defined ovoid opacity over the left caudal thoracic wall on the VD view. There are 2-3 broad-based fat opaque subcutaneous protrusions along the ventral thorax, largest at the level of the xiphoid process.

Abdomen: The serosal detail is normal. The stomach contains a small amount of gas. Only on the ventrodorsal view, there is a rounded soft tissue opacity (2.5cm x 3.2cm) superimposed with the gastric lumen, to the left of the spine. Small intestines are normal in diameter, distribution, and content. Colon diffusely contains fecal material. The visible margins of liver, spleen, kidneys, and urinary bladder are normal.
","\- The moderate to severe left cardiomegaly combined with mild pulmonary venous congestion and caudodorsal interstitial pattern, is most concerning for mild cardiogenic edema secondary to left-sided heart failure. Diuretic trial and repeat radiographs could be considered to monitor for resolution of the caudodorsal pulmonary pattern. Also, referral for echocardiogram could be performed to better characterize heart disease and function.
\-The ventral margin of soft tissue opacity on the thoracic lateral view at the level of the costochondral junctions is an incidental summation artifact with the pleura and angle of the thorax at this level.
\-Nonspecific dorsal subcutaneous mass that is not confidently fat opaque so could represent benign or malignant etiologies. Correlate to tissue sampling.
\-Small subcutaneous adipose masses, likely benign lipomas.
\-The rounded soft tissue opacity seen superimposed with the stomach on only the ventrodorsal view could be within the gastric lumen (intentional food or foreign body), but considered more likely incidental given the lack of any vomiting or anorexia.

11/29/2024 Study Findings: 

There is a questionable diffuse bronchial pulmonary pattern. The cardiovascular structures are normal. On the right lateral view, there is increased soft tissue opacity in the mid ventral thorax partially overlying the cardiac silhouette with a slight angular/triangular margin cranially; however, margination of the cardiac silhouette is maintained. There is questionable tenting of the diaphragm.

There is a more distinct bronchial pulmonary pattern compared to the previous but this bronchial pulmonary pattern is only considered mild at this time. A few minute nodular soft tissue opacities are noted throughout the lungs. On the VD view, there is mild widening of the caudal mediastinal reflection due to incidental fat deposition causing a band-like to triangular opacity in this region. The cardiovascular structures. There is a small triangular soft tissue opacity in the mid ventral lung field on the right lateral view, just cranial to the cardiac silhouette. The band of increased soft tissue overlying the cardiac silhouette noted on this view in the previous study is no longer present. Questionable diaphragmatic tenting is again noted on the VD view. 
","1. Mild diffuse bronchial pulmonary pattern with persistent questionable diaphragmatic tenting is most consistent with inflammatory lower airway disease (e.g. feline asthma). This pattern is more distinct than previous which could be due to variations in radiographic technique and post-processing algorithms; however, true progression of disease cannot be excluded. 
2. The minute nodular soft tissue opacities noted in today's study are most compatible with mucus filled terminal bronchi, minute broncholiths and/or incidental pulmonary osteomas. The size of these lesions is not consistent with metastatic disease. 
3. There is no evidence of overt cardiovascular disease in either study. Additionally, there is no evidence of CHF in either study. 
4. The increased soft tissue opacity in the mid ventral lung field noted on the right lateral views in both studies (extent of this opacity varies between studies) is most compatible with incidental mediastinal fat deposition and transient focal atelectasis. There is no conclusive pleural effusion in either study (the appearance of the right mid ventral lung field on the 11/29/2024 is considered to be an example of pseudo-pleural effusion).

The rotation of the patient, movement artifact, and poor collimation of the radiographs, including the thorax and abdomen, decrease the resolution of the finer details of the thorax and increase the amount of image graininess and artifact. This practice should be avoided. Consider collimated radiographs only to include the thorax, which may be helpful to better assess for pulmonary changes. 

There is marked dorsal angulation of the mid to caudal sternum, causing marked rotation of the cardiac silhouette to the left side and decreased volume of the left cranial lung lobe. Subjectively, the cardiac silhouette is enlarged.

","Right tarsal changes and regional lymphadenopathy, in conjunction with provided cytology results and discussion with an orthopedic surgeon, are most consistent with septic arthritis. This cases was discussed with one of our orthopedic surgeons (Dr. Karl Maritato) and he said that it is fairly common to not get growth on culture in cats with septic arthritis so this does not exclude this disease process. The primary neoplastic process I would have considered is tarsal lymphoma, which should have exfoliated well and been apparent on the previously performed cytology making neoplasia unlikely at this time. Additionally, given that only one joint is affected, an autoimmune-mediated arthritis is considered unlikely. Dr. Maritato recommended treating with an antibiotic that has 4 quadrant coverage and if a clinical response is observed to treat for at least 8 weeks. 

Consider consultation with an orthopedic surgeon if additional discussion of treatment options is required.

The colon is moderately distended with well-formed fecal material, some of which is mildly mineral opaque.  The urinary bladder is normal.  Evaluation of the liver, spleen, and kidneys is partially hampered by superimposition of gastrointestinal segments and mildly poor abdominal serosal detail as a consequence of thin body habitus, but no conclusive abnormalities of the solid abdominal viscera is identified.

","1.  The right middle lung lobe pulmonary infiltrate is most consistent with aspiration pneumonia.  A pulmonary mass is less likely.  An orthogonal image (left lateral image of the thorax) could provide more information.

2.  Mineral in the plane of the liver could represent cholelithiasis.  In combination with the lung mineral, could support an underlying condition resulting in metastatic mineralization (e.g., kidney disease, hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D intoxication).

Thorax: There are multiple thoracolumbar vertebral malformations (shortened, wedge-shaped, hemi-vertebrae, fused spinous processes, possibly fused L1L2), creating focal kyphosis at the thoracolumbar junction, rib crowding, and a shortened but tall thoracic cavity conformation. Best appreciated on the left lateral view (TOI: 15:39:02) there is a questionable interstitial pulmonary opacity and small ill-defined air bronchograms overlying the cranial aspect of the cardiac silhouette. There is a mild bronchial and interstitial pattern throughout the mid to caudodorsal pulmonary parenchyma which is improved on the VD/DV views. On the presumed DV view there is rounded increased opacity effacing with the right cranial thorax while the cardiac silhouette seems deviated to the left. On lateral views there is variably increased opacity of the cranial thorax that partially summates with the cardiac silhouette due to summation with proximal forelimb soft tissues, best appreciated on right lateral view).  Otherwise the cardiovascular structures are normal. The pleural space is normal. 

Abdomen: There is decreased serosal detail due to a combination of thin body condition, visceral crowding by distended stomach, and patient's conformation. Stomach is normally positioned and moderately to markedly distended with a combination of gas and heterogeneous nodular soft tissue material (most consistent with ingesta). No over small intestinal dilation. There is ill-defined lobular granular fecal material in the colon +/- cecum. Visible margins of liver, spleen, kidneys and urinary bladder are normal. There are malformations of the included spine (asymmetric last ribs, fusion and malformation of last lumbar vertebrae, likely spine bifida of the last fused L6/L7 and sacrum based on VD view, shortened fused and malformed sacrocaudal vertebrae). On the latest acquired lateral view (following passage of tube) the stomach is decreased in size by about 40%. 
","\- Suspect aspiration pneumonia in right cranial thorax. Remaining diffuse pulmonary pattern suggests chronic lower airway inflammatory disease. 
\- The right cranial thoracic opacity on presumed DV view is suspected to be from pulmonary infiltrate though given its slightly convex margin caudally and leftward shift of the cardiac silhouette, a mass (heart base) cannot entirely be ruled out. This would be unusual as heart based or mediastinal tumors are predominantly left sided, but not always. Repeated three view thoracic radiographs collimated more to the thorax with the forelimbs pulled as far forward as possible could be considered for radiographic monitoring, including in response to treatment for the suspected pneumonia. Ultimately CT of the thorax would be the most sensitive modality to evaluate the cranial thoracic structures, particularly given patient's conformation.

","Unusual oblong area of geographic lucency in the distal diaphysis/metaphysis of the left ulna.  The shape of this lucency and its location are atypical for a retained cartilaginous core, and the breed is also atypical for this diagnosis.  Therefore, the most likely differential is considered to be a benign bone cyst, as no conclusively aggressive characteristics are noted of this lesion. The possibility that this lesion represents round cell tumor cannot be ruled out but is considered less likely.  The lack of conclusively aggressive characteristics suggests that aggressive bone tumors such as osteosarcoma are highly unlikely.
Consultation with an orthopedist is recommended for further evaluation as bone biopsy will likely be the only method to determine a definitive diagnosis; however, there is a risk of iatrogenic fracture with such a procedure, and thus full evaluation and consultation with an orthopedist is recommended.

There is mild diffuse thickening of the airways.  The cardiovascular structures, pleural space, and mediastinum are normal. Incidentally, the xyphoid process is ventrally deviated. A couple mineral foci are interspersed within some heterogeneous soft tissue in the stomach.  The patient is over-conditioned.
","1.  Diffuse mild airway thickening supports chronic lower airway inflammation, commonly of allergic origin (asthma).  Other etiologies (e.g., inflammatory, infectious, irritant) also remain possible.
2.  Normal cardiovascular structures.  There is no evidence of congestive heart failure.

803419,"Three orthogonal images of the thorax and two orthogonal images of the abdomen are evaluated (5 total):

Thorax:
On the first image, the patient is intubated and there is a severe diffuse unstructured interstitial to alveolar pulmonary pattern that persists to a lesser degress on subsequent images. After extubation, the esophagus is diffusely moderately gas dilated. Evident on the left lateral and VD images, there are large rounded soft tissue opacities in the plane of the craniodorsal mediastinum (left lateral only), and the mid ventral aspects of the right cranial and right caudal lung lobes.  The opacity in the right cranial lung lobe is seemingly positioned around a bronchus. Gas cavitations are possibly associated with the most caudally positioned soft tissue opacity.  On the left lateral image, a small ovoid soft tissue opacity is dorsal to the first and second sternebrae.  On the VD image, there is a mild leftward mediastinal shift with volume reduction of the left lung and increased overall soft tissue opacity, consistent with pulmonary atelectasis.  This is likely exacerbated by patient obliquity. The cardiovascular structures and pleural space are normal.

Abdomen:
The abdominal serosal detail is normal. The stomach is normal in size and contains a small volume of gas. The small intestines are normal in size and content. The cecum contains gas and a small volume of formed feces.  The colon contains a large volume of formed, partially mineralized feces. The spleen is mildly enlarged with rounded margins. The right liver is mildly enlarged with rounded margins resulting in caudal displacement of the gastric axis. The kidneys, and urinary bladder are normal. The musculoskeletal structures are normal.
 
","1.  There is the impression of multiple right-sided rounded soft tissue masses (at least one cavitated) which is concerning for pulmonary neoplasia. That being said, severe anesthesia-induced pulmonary atelectasis hinders evaluation of these structures and further diagnostics are recommended for confirmation.  
2.  Possible sternal lymphadenopathy versus superimposition of a smaller pulmonary nodule.
3.  Aerophagia.
4.  Right-sided hepatomegaly could support a nonspecific hepatopathy or hepatic mass.
5.  Splenomegaly could be consistent with benign (e.g., extramedullary hematopoiesis, nodular hyperplasia, congestion) or malignant (e.g., neoplasia) etiologies.

Best appreciated on the initial DP views (image #4 and #5) there is focal soft tissue swelling overlying the lateral aspect of the carpus and carpometacarpal joint. On these images there is also suspect smooth to lobular mineral opacity adjacent to the bone, just overlying the carpometacarpal joint. There is mild indentation at the distomedial aspect of the 2nd metacarpal bone, considered normal contour from collateral ligament attachments. No abnormalities of the right shoulder and carpus. 
","\-Focal swelling at lateral aspect of carpus. A traumatic soft tissue injury is considered (underlying ligamentous, tendon, muscle or joint capsule damage) or abscess. Neoplasia is less likely given age and sudden onset. There is questionable mineralization in the deeper aspect of the swelling, such as from reactive periostitis or dystrophic mineralization. It seems too smooth to be from avulsion fragment and there is no obvious affected parent bone. The mineralization seen dorsal to radial carpal bone on only one lateral view may have been artifactual (such as debris in fur) or representative of the same suspected mineralization.

There is a prominent pleural fissure on the right lateral view of the more recent study, overlying the caudal aspect of the cardiac silhouette. No evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. There is a broad-based soft tissue opacity overlying the dorsal lumen of the trachea on the more recent right lateral view with maintained uniform luminal height.

Opposite lateral and VD views dated 1/16/2025 are compared to a study dated 12/12/2024. 

In the initial study, there is a diffuse bronchointerstitial pulmonary pattern that is likely exaggerated by artifact of patient expiration and patient body habitus. In the most recent study, there is now ventrally distributed alveolar infiltrates in the left lung fields and questionably the right cranial lung lobe. There is a mild bronchointerstitial pattern in the remainder of the right lung lobes. There is no overt bronchial dilation in either study. The cardiovascular structures and pleural space are normal both studies. There is a new finding of moderate to marked generalized gas dilation of the esophagus in the most recent study (only transient minimal gas distension was noted in the thoracic esophagus on the left lateral view considered incidental in that study). There is an incidental finding of multifocal spondylosis deformans in the included portions of the spine. 
","1. The ventrally distributed alveolar infiltrates (definitively in the left lung lobes and questionably in the right cranial lung lobe) are most consistent with aspiration pneumonia/bronchopneumonia. 
2. Diffuse bronchointerstitial pulmonary pattern noted in both studies is a non-specific finding. Given history, a component of inflammatory lower airway disease (e.g. bronchitis) should be given priority. A component of normal age-related change and artifact is likely contributing to this pattern. 
3. New finding of generalized esophageal dilation may be due to transient aerophagia secondary to pneumonia; however, an underlying esophageal dysmotility disorder (e.g. megaesophagus) cannot be excluded (this may have been the inciting cause for the pneumonia).

Lateral and DV views dated 1/16/2025 are compared to a study dated 12/3/2024. 

There is now heterogeneous increased soft tissue opacity throughout the left nasal passage with questionable loss of at least some turbinates. No conclusive nasal passage abnormalities were present in the previous study. No conclusive abnormalities are present in the frontal sinuses in either study. Besides possible nasal turbinate loss in the most recent study, there is no evidence of overt lysis of craniofacial bones. Dentition is unremarkable based on provided projections. The larynx, pharynx, and retropharyngeal region are normal in both studies.

The pulmonary parenchyma, cardiovascular structures, pleural space and mediastinum are normal. 
","1. Increased soft tissue opacity in the left nasal passage with questionable loss of nasal turbinates, in conjunction with patient signalment and history, is most concerning for primary sinonasal neoplasia such as adenocarcinoma. Infectious/inflammatory rhinitis cannot be excluded. CT of the head with possible nasal cavity biopsies is recommended. 
2. Normal thorax with no evidence of thoracic metastatic disease.

Thorax:
The cardiovascular structures and pleural space are normal. There is a small volume of caudal esophageal fluid on the lateral images, considered incidental. The mediastinum is otherwise normal.  On the right lateral image, there is a round soft tissue nodule in the plane of the craniovental diaphragm that is not corroborated on orthogonal images.  Incidentally, there is mild multifocal spondylosis deformans of the included spine.

Abdomen:
The abdominal serosal detail is normal. The stomach is normal in size and contains a moderate volume of homogeneous soft tissue and gas. The small intestines are normal in size and contain a mixture of homogeneous and frothy soft tissue/fluid and gas. The cecum and colon contain a moderate volume of partially formed feces and gas. The liver, visible renal margins, and urinary bladder are normal. The spleen is absent.  The left acetabulum is shallow with poor coverage of the femoral head. The left femoral head and neck are thickened with moderate periarticular new bone.

A cause for the reported coughing is not identified radiographically; however, radiographs can be insensitive to lower airway change (e.g., bronchitis). If the patient is not responding to empirical therapies, a lower airway wash could provide more information. Given reported heart murmur, an echocardiograph could be beneficial to more closely assess cardiac structure and function. An abdominal ultrasound could be considered to rule out a primary intra-abdominal tumor.

Thorax radiographs: There is a severe diffuse unstructured interstitial pattern that seems to become more condensed towards the perihilar region from which multiple wispy to linear bands of soft tissue infiltrate seem to radiate. A component of the pattern seems strongly peribronchial with multifocal regions of bronchial wall thickening. Particularly on the right lateral view there is questionable rounded soft tissue opacity dorsal to the carina, suggestive of tracheobronchial lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular structures are normal.

Opposite lateral and VD views dated 12/5/2024 are available. 

Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette is hindered to some degree due to an ill-defined cranial margin on all views (a vertebral heart score cannot be performed). On the lateral views, the cardiac silhouette is considered normal. On the VD view, there is the impression of mild generalized cardiomegaly but no specific chamber enlargement is present. The pulmonary vessels are normal. There is a mild diffuse bronchial pulmonary pattern. There is focal rightward bowing of the trachea over the cranial half of the cardiac silhouette on the VD view. There is dorsal tracheal bowing on the right lateral view; however, this is suspected to be an artifact of patient positioning as there is significant patient obliquity in this view and there is no corresponding tracheal deviation in the left lateral view. The pleural space is normal. There are hemivertebrae in the thoracolumbar junction, a common and typically incidental finding in this breed.
","1. Mild diffuse bronchial pulmonary pattern, in conjunction with history, is most compatible with inflammatory lower airway disease (e.g. bronchitis). 
2. Appearance of the cardiac silhouette on the VD view is likely a normal breed variant; however, true underlying cardiovascular disease cannot be excluded.
3. Tracheal deviation on the VD view is likely an incidental finding as no conclusive mass-like lesion is noted in this region and there is no corresponding deviation on the lateral views. However, given the breed, the possibility of an underlying heart base tumor cannot be completely excluded based on this study.

There is moderate ill-defined soft tissue thickening of the bronchial walls. There is an indistinct moderate unstructured interstitial to alveolar pattern within the mid to caudolateral aspect of the left caudal lung lobe, best identified on the VD image. 
Pleural space and mediastinum are within normal limits.
There is bilateral osteophytosis of the scapulohumeral joints.
Likely incidental spondylosis deformans. 

Single Right Lateral Abdominal Radiographic Study:

The liver is mildly enlarged with rounded margins. 
The prostate is moderate to markedly enlarged and rounded with well-defined margins. 
The stomach is mildly filled with gas. The small intestines are multifocally mildly filled with homogeneous soft tissue opacity with no evidence of two populations of the bowel. The large intestine is multifocally filled with heterogeneous fecal material and gas.
The visible splenic, renal, and serosal margins are normal.
No abnormalities at the included osseous structures.
Likely incidental spondylosis deformans.
","Nonspecific left caudal lung interstitial to alveolar pattern suggests noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (including secondary to pulmonary hypertension), less likely atypical pneumonia, PTEs, neoplasia (e.g., lymphoma), or atelectasis. No evidence of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. 
Age-related bronchial changes, chronic lower airway disease (e.g., chronic bronchitis), or interstitial lung disease (e.g., fibrosis).
Nonspecific hepatomegaly (e.g., vacuolar hepatopathy, hepatitis, neoplasia).
Bilateral shoulder degenerative joint disease.
Likely benign prostatic hyperplasia. 
Limited abdominal study.

803299,"THORAX/ABDOMEN (2 images total):
The patient is under conditioned. There is a marked increase in bronchial /peribronchial markings throughout the lungs. Patchy consolidation is suggested at the cranial aspect of the cranial lung lobes. No pulmonary nodules are identified. The cardiac silhouette is normal in size and contour. The pulmonary vessels, pleural space, and mediastinum are normal. 

The stomach is mildly distended with gas and a conglomerate of soft tissue material. The small intestine is moderately distended with gas and fluid. The colon contains gas and formed feces the liver, spleen, kidneys, and urinary bladder are within normal limits. There is appropriate serosal detail. 
","Marked, diffuse, bronchial/peribronchial pulmonary markings and patchy cranial lung consolidation suggesting severe, chronic lower airway disease such as asthma and bronchitis with concurrent cranial pneumonia. 

If symptoms or radiographic lung changes do not improve with the medical therapy, recommend internal medicine consultation.

803298,"Three-view thoracic radiographs including right lateral, left lateral, and VD views (3 total images) provided as JPEGs by referring DVM dated 11/26/2024.

Findings:
- Moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, spanning greater than 2/3 of the thoracic width on the VD view, characterized by dorsal deviation of the trachea, straightening of the caudal margins, and increased sternal contact. Moderate amount of fat within the pericardial space highlighting the ventral aspect of the heart.
\- Normal pulmonary vasculature.
\- Mild diffuse bronchial pulmonary pattern.
\- Thin fusiform shaped soft tissue opaque band along the dorsal tracheal margin causing mild narrowing of the gas filled tracheal lumen.
- Normal pleural space and mediastinum, with increased amount of fat in both spaces.
- Included cranial abdominal structures are normal.
- Included musculoskeletal structures are normal.
","1. Compensated left and right sided cardiomegaly. DDx: congenital cardiac disease (e.g. ventricular or atrial septal defect, valvular dysplasia, etc.) or acquired cardiac disease such as dilated cardiomyopathy (especially if there is a history of a grain free diet) or mitral/tricuspid valve degeneration. 
2. Mild diffuse bronchitis may indicated a community acquired infection (such as kennel cough) or chronic lower airway disease such as allergic (asthma), inflammatory (eosinophilic bronchopneumonopathy) , or infectious bronchitis (mycoplasma). 
3. Redundant tracheal membrane. 
4. Overconditioned.
